        Starting a Data Science Project: Investigative Considerations for
        Stakeholders
      </h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Initiating a data science project requires a methodical and inquisitive
        approach. Every project presents unique challenges, opportunities, and
        unknowns. This document offers a framework for stakeholders to approach
        data science projects with a structured, evidence-based mindset. By
        grounding decisions in the scientific method, you can ensure that
        conclusions are driven by data rather than instinct, avoiding the
        pitfalls of intuition and instead focusing on systematic investigation
        and empirical decision-making.
